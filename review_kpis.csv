 the seats were “cupped” so you sunk into the middle when you lie them flat. Uncomfortable! This could have been softened by an attentive and helpful staff member however even getting water was difficult. The flight attendants didn’t offer anything between breakfast and lunch nor between lunch and dinner. For business class,1,4.0
 the meal was average but did taste very good. Lastly,1,4.0
 and the newest version of the in-flight entertainment is a big bonus for this short hop flight. Seating is comfortable for this duration of flight (way better than the experience in an A320 or B737). We left on time,1,4.0

 get a quote and send it to them and then they will pay for the repair. We did that and after 2 some time they got back to us saying that what we sent them was a quote and they need an invoice even though they asked for a writen quote. Anyway we send the invoice with a long message saying please try to resolve this quickly as my mother in confined until she gets her scooter back.

" referencing their recent sponsorship was a nice touch. Both internet access (free of charge for J Pax) and live TV available throughout flight. Even managed to get a brief nap before our landing to Heathrow thanks to the comfort of the lie-flat seats. All in all a 5-Star experience considering this being a intra-Europe flight. Excellent value for money.""",1,

 we were told that the meat options had gone. My wife cannot eat pasta so was given a vegetarian dish which looked very unappetising and my pasta was lukewarm and dry. The attitude of the cabin crew was that it was our fault as we should have pre-ordered a special meal. ,1,

" the headsets were awful - seeming to increase engine noise and necessitating deafening volume to hear anything on screen. The seat cushion was a bit lacking in padding. Wine arrived early but from about climb out and for nearly 3 hours we experienced severe turbulence and in spite of regular calls for seat belts to be fastened and even the crew having to return to their seats for lengthy periods the service was somehow maintained. Dinner this time was king prawns with rice and greens in sweet chile sauce and better than we have often had in business class. The approach to Lisbon was equally bumpy but finishing with an excellent smooth landing about 20 minutes late. When I complimented the purser on the staff performance she invited me to their area at the rear to repeat my comments """"because I want them all to hear your compliments"""" and gave me a couple of Drambuies to take home as a souvenir. There can be no better way to fly economy than this although try to get the B777-300ER and possibly bring your own noise cancelling headset.""",1,

" who I took on the last leg of my trip. I think Korean Air is overrated.""",1,
" I had no other passengers seated next to me and it was so comfortable and relaxing throughout my longest flight ever. The only down factor was that it was very cold throughout the night. My feet were very cold because of the air conditioner and of course flying over oceans too. I loved the fact that the flight attendant handed passengers disembarking from the airline for Hong Kong special visitor slips. I think it was really handy and going through immigration went quite fast. Thank you to Cathay Pacific flight CX 749 back to OR Tambo International Aiport from Hong Kong on the 16th June for giving me a last-minute seat onboard this flight because I missed my actual flight on the 15th June 2019 back to South Africa. Cathay Pacific flight CX 749 was really comfortable and much warmer on board and the service was good but can be improved. I will definitely fly again with Cathay Pacific in the future.""",1,

 not until we were boarding on the ramp did I realize my seat was moved. At the door of the plane I asked why this was. They told me because I couldn't help in the case of an emergency. They put me in a middle seat behind this exit aisle. When I requested a change of seat they said there was nothing left but Economy Plus - something I would need to pay for if I wanted extra room.  I had no choice but to upgrade my seat to ensure my leg was elevated (can you imagine a 15 hour flight with no pain medication and the cabin pressure causing extreme discomfort... well don't worry this airline can't imagine it either). They charged me $2,1,

 luckily he didn't eat them. When we told cabin crew that he was supposed to have been served a nut free vegetarian meal they said we never would have been promised such a thing because it didn't exist. When we showed proof of Singapore Airlines emails promising us a nut-free vegetarian meal the steward seemed disgruntled that we had proved we weren't lying about it all. A female stewardess found something my partner could eat. Pluses: Female members of staff = fab. Clean and comfy aircraft. Pretty decent snacks and entertainment. We didn't pay to be sat together and yet we still were on each leg of the journey. I'm giving it all a 7 because the journey was just about okay,1,

 a hot sandwich sounded fine but was something like heated cabbage and carrots in a stale bread roll. The breakfast was slightly more edible but the yoghurt with the texture of cottage cheese was not. The inflight entertainment is old and low resolution with a below average selection of tv and films. The general approach from cabin crew was absolutely fine although there was no effort to check on or provide any service between meals. Most competitors these days will come through the cabin during the night with cold drinks and many also offers snacks like ice creams etc. The seats felt old and while were fine on first sitting down,1,
Auckland to Dublin via Hong Kong,1,
" spacious and seem in a good condition. The seats had plenty of legroom and space to have a pleasant trip specially on long flights but are similar to other major airlines. One issue about the business class seats is that we can't see from the windows because of the seat conception which is inconvenient for a lot of passengers. The flight attendants were not very service oriented and did not seem very friendly. Usually the crew start to take the meal orders before the plane pushes back but on my last leg they did it once the plane was airborne. The crew from and to Bali legs were a bit better. Some of them don't even ask if we needed something else or a drink during the meal service and they took a very long time take the dishes. I had to ask twice to get my drink and another time later for a coffee which was very long to have it. However the food was tasty and good. The in flying entertainment was also good and had many choices of movies and TV shows. The flights were uneventful but pleasant in general besides the crew with the seat that can be turn into a bed with a big screen tv. Overall Turkish airlines has a good product for long haul fights and delicious food. """,1,

 and then a lady likes a Representative of EK appeared and made a contact with passengers in lounge to announce that flight was delayed more. And in long time waiting that lady appeared again to notice that the incoming flight from DXB landed in Kishinev (Moldova)- KIV and then flew back at ODS in a couple time. We and passengers on this flight have continued to wait. Nearly 02 hours later the lady informed that the incoming flight would flight back to ODS,1,
JFK to MNL via DXB,1,
" she was refused access to the plane because she did not have a negative PCR. How can an Air France agent let her board a plane for the USA without checking or asking about the PCR test and still clear her to board a plane. I have been trying to reach someone at Air France and file a complaint but because my booking is with Air Europa I cannot do so. I filed a complaint with Air Europa and of course am ignored. I texted many employees from corporate with Air France and each time asked to contact Air Europa. This is disrespectful and unprofessional because Air France should be aware of the wrong doing of their employees and make sure this mistake does not happen again.""",1,
